# Fix Project Switch Restart Bug


Fix some Sublime Text sections issues as does not set the last scroll position after a project change.
1. [SublimeTextIssues#1379](https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/1379) Restore session, does not set the last scroll position after a project change, or sublime restart
1. [BufferScroll#23](https://github.com/titoBouzout/BufferScroll/issues/23) Scroll sync doesn't work (ST3 3084)

Need to fix to the bug on the Sublime Text core, where all cloned views are called with the same
view object. If we do not fix this here, it would set all the cloned views to the same
position. So to overcome this, we call all the views to center with `plugin_loaded()`.

#1253 Event handlers for cloned views get called with the wrong view object
https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/1253

The `on_load_async()` is called for each view on for the project change, however
due the bug https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/1253, the cloned
views are called with the wrong `view`, then we need to call `plugin_loaded()` to catch
all the correct views (including the cloned ones) to apply the scroll fix for the bug
